# `authpswd`

:::warning

This page is out of date. Instead of using `authpswd`, it is recommended to get
a token from
[/auth/login](https://docs.meower.org/api/rest#/operations/post_login) with the
REST API, then connect to the websocket with the URL
`wss://server.meower.org/?v=1&token={your token from api}`

:::

This command is used to log into Meower.
